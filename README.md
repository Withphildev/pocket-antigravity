Remote web interface for [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) Agent Manager.  
Access your local Antigravity sessions from your phone, tablet, or any remote browser through a lightweight LSP bridge.

Pocket Antigravity is a two-part system: a **proxy** that bridges your local Antigravity Language Server to the network, and a **web UI** (installable PWA) that gives you a mobile-friendly chat interface.

## Quick start

**Prerequisites**: **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ≥ 22**, **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) ≥ 10**, and a running
[Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) instance.

> **Warning:** Porta is a bridge to Antigravity. If Antigravity is not
> running, the proxy will start but cannot connect to any session.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/L1M80/porta.git
cd porta
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # edit if needed — see comments inside
pnpm dev               # proxy (:3170) + web (:5173)
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### LAN access

To access from another device on your home network:

```bash
# Set PORTA_HOST to this machine's LAN IP in .env
PORTA_HOST=192.168.1.23
```

Devices on the same network can reach the proxy at `http://192.168.1.23:3170`.  
Wildcard binds (`0.0.0.0`, `::`) and public IPs are rejected at startup for safety.

> **Note:** to also access the Vite dev UI from LAN, start it with `--host`:
>
> ```bash
> pnpm --filter @porta/web dev -- --host
> ```

## Why Porta?

There are several ways to access a local development environment
remotely. Here's how Porta compares:

| Approach                              | Data sent           | Bandwidth      | Latency                   | Mobile UX                    | Self-hosted |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Screen sharing** (VNC, RDP, Parsec) | Pixel stream        | High           | Noticeable                | Poor: tiny text, no touch UX | ✅          |
| **SSH + port forwarding**             | Raw TCP             | Low            | Low                       | No UI: terminal only         | ✅          |
| **Cloud IDE** (Codespaces, Gitpod)    | Full workspace      | N/A (cloud)    | Varies                    | Usable but heavy             | ❌          |
| **Pocket Antigravity**                 | Structured LSP data | **Negligible** | **Real-time** (WebSocket) | **Native PWA**               | ✅          |

Pocket Antigravity doesn't stream pixels or run your workspace in the cloud. It
relays structured conversation data through the Antigravity Language
Server Protocol, so you get:

- **Near-zero bandwidth**: JSON messages, not video frames
- **Real-time streaming**: WebSocket push, no polling lag
- **Native mobile experience**: [installable PWA](docs/pwa.md) with touch-optimized UI
- **Full privacy**: your code and conversations never leave your machine
- **No vendor lock-in**: self-hosted, MIT-licensed, works with any Antigravity installation

## Limitations

Porta is a **chat interface**, not a full remote IDE. These
constraints are inherent to its LSP-bridge architecture:

- **Antigravity must be running**: Pocket Antigravity is a bridge, not a
  standalone tool. No Antigravity instance → no data.
- **Bounded by Antigravity**: Pocket Antigravity can only expose what the
  Antigravity Language Server provides. If Antigravity doesn't support
  a feature, Pocket Antigravity can't offer it either.
- **No code editing or terminal**: Pocket Antigravity relays conversation-level
  data only. Use your local editor or SSH for file operations.
- **Single user**: The proxy connects to one local Antigravity
  Language Server. There is no multi-user or multi-tenant model.

### Platform support

| Tier       | Platform    | Status                                               |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tier 1** | Linux (x64) | Developed and tested on real hardware                |
| **Tier 2** | Windows     | Tested on real hardware; less extensively than Linux |
| **Tier 3** | macOS       | CI passes; no real-hardware testing by maintainers   |

> Porta's proxy must run on the **same side** as Antigravity. If
> Antigravity runs on your Windows host, run Porta from PowerShell / cmd,
> **not** from inside WSL2. Conversely, if Antigravity runs inside WSL2,
> run Porta from WSL2, **not** from Windows. The two environments cannot
> see each other's processes.

## Remote access with Cloudflare

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Browser

  subgraph CF ["Cloudflare (optional)"]
    Pages["Pages(static SPA)"]
    Tunnel
    ZT["Zero Trust"]
  end

  subgraph Local ["Your machine"]
    Proxy["Proxy(:3170)"]
    LS["Antigravity LS"]
  end

  Browser -- HTTPS --> Pages --> ZT --> Tunnel --> Proxy --> LS
  Browser -. local .-> Proxy
```

- **Local-only mode** (Quick start above): Browser → Proxy → LS. No cloud services needed.
- **Remote mode**: Cloudflare Pages + Tunnel + Zero Trust for secure remote access without exposing your network.

Cloudflare can be used in two different ways:

### Option A: Quick Tunnel (temporary testing)

If you only want to try Porta remotely and do not need a stable hostname, use a
Cloudflare Quick Tunnel.

- No custom domain required
- Best for demos and short-lived testing
- Not recommended for ongoing use: the hostname is temporary, and Cloudflare documents Quick Tunnels as testing-only infrastructure

To avoid stale copy-pasted instructions, follow Cloudflare's current docs:

- [Quick Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/)
- [Cloudflare Tunnel setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/setup/)

Use a named tunnel instead if you want a stable `VITE_API_BASE`, a fixed Cloudflare
Pages deployment, or long-lived remote access.

### Option B: Named tunnel + Pages (recommended for regular remote use)

This is the stable pattern for ongoing remote access. It requires:

- A **Cloudflare** account
- **Cloudflare Tunnel** (`cloudflared`) installed and authenticated
- A **Cloudflare Pages** project (for hosting the static SPA)
- A domain managed by **Cloudflare** for the tunnel hostname
- Optionally, **Cloudflare Zero Trust** for authentication

### 1. Configure `.env`

Set the proxy runtime and Cloudflare-related variables in `.env`:

```bash
# .env
PORTA_CORS_ORIGINS=https://<YOUR_PAGES_DOMAIN>
PORTA_TUNNEL_NAME=<YOUR_TUNNEL_NAME>
PORTA_CF_PROJECT=<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

### 2. Create the named tunnel

Point the tunnel at your local proxy:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create <YOUR_TUNNEL_NAME>
cloudflared tunnel route dns <YOUR_TUNNEL_NAME> <YOUR_API_SUBDOMAIN>
```

### 3. Create `.env.production`

Create `.env.production` in the repo root for the web build:

```bash
# .env.production
VITE_API_BASE=https://<YOUR_API_SUBDOMAIN>
```

### 4. Build and deploy the SPA

```bash
pnpm deploy
```

This uses `PORTA_CF_PROJECT` from `.env`. If you prefer, you can run the
equivalent `wrangler pages deploy` command manually.

### 5. Start the proxy + named tunnel

```bash
pnpm dev:cloud
```

This reads `PORTA_TUNNEL_NAME` from `.env` and starts the proxy and
`cloudflared tunnel run` together.
